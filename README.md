# i2c_simple_pill_driver

SimpleFOC I2CCommander for the BluePill

The objective of this project is to implement a working example of the I2CCommander running on a BluePill. The I2CCommander is part of the SimpleFOC-Drivers library.

In addition to the arduino example implemented for the BluePill there is another example implemented for the ESP32  that should work as the I2CMasterCommander, this is the brain MCU as it is called in the SimpleFOC-Drivers lib.
